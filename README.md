# CashOptimizer
This function determines the optimal combination of cash-units (i.e. coins, banknotes) for a given price. Since this has no real-world implementation as far as I can see, I won't turn this into a more thoroughly coded project.

Implemented are the currencies EUR and USD, other currencies can be added as lists containing their respective cash-units.

The output for e.g. 5.26 $ would be 1x 5$-bill, 1x 25ct, 1x 1ct.
